# Part 1: Roundtable Lightning Talks

## Overview

In this section, you will be presenting three potential topics to your coursemates (and fellow well-wishers!) You will be presenting your findings in the form of an informal [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk). 

**You do not need to prepare slides for your talk.  Just be prepared to discuss it with your colleagues.**

## How to select a topic

You can think about selecting a topic (at least) two ways:

1. Start with an idea then look for potential data that could support that idea.
2. Look for interesting data then think about what problems could be solved with that data.

> Throughout the capstone process it will be very valuable if you *document as you go!*  Perhaps keep a project journal (hard copy, text file or digital notebook) describing your decisions and findings.  This is will be a useful reminder for "future you" (who tends to forget your past decisions), and it will also be useful fodder for generating your final report.

## What is a lightning talk?

For our purposes, a lightning talk is a talk lasting **no more than five minutes**, in which you will discuss the following about your three proposed projects:

1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?
4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
5. What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?
6. Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?

Time limits will be strictly enforced.

> Note that you *should not* prepare slides for your talk.  This will be verbal pitches with discussion.

## Recommendations for your lightning talk

Think about your talk as a short pitch.  It will be helpful to practice your talk beforehand!  Keep it short, succinct and to the point.

Bolded and capitalized for as much effect as possible:

**HAVE YOUR DATA IN HAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**

There is no penalty for having to switch topics or datasets in the middle of the project, provided that you can still deliver on the other portions of this work. However, if you can get the data in hand as soon as possible, you can prevent yourself a lot of extra work. 

## Deliverables

Be prepared to discuss 3 potential topics with your peers.
