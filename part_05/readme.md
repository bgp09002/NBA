# Part 5

## Congratulations!

Welcome to the final day and final submission for DSI-US-9! It has been a long road and a challenging 3 months, but welcome to your final stop: the presentation!

## Deliverable

You will present your project and findings in a 15 minute presentation on _TBD_! You should expect the members of your audience to be non-technical in nature. Your presentation should provide a summary of your problem, your approach to modeling that problem, and your ultimate findings. 

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Make sure your presentation fits within the allotted time!  Check with your local instructor for exactly how much time you have.
- Your presentation should focus on summarizing your problem statement, your approach, your findings, and how it might be used in the future.
- You will not be able to present every facet of your work, so please do not try to do that! Instead, try and identify the most salient points of your project and show those off instead.
- Particularly when presenting to a non-technical audience, remember that what and why can be much more interesting than how:
  - What are you trying to predict?
  - Why are you doing it?  Who cares?
  - What are some predictions your model has made?  Where they any good?
  - What will you use it for in the future?  Are there limitations or risks?
  - Do not use technical terms unless you can clearly and succinctly define them.
- Note, you will not need to go into _how_ you picked your model or _how_ you chose your hyperparameters (in fact, usually better to keep hyperparameters just to us data scientists!)
- Try to craft a story/narrative around your project.  Don't just dump facts on your audience.
- Have _fun_! This is a celebration of the 12 weeks of hard work that you have done!

## Requirements

One 15 minute presentation given to your fellow classmates and well-wishers.  This presentation should be geared for a *non-technical* audience.
